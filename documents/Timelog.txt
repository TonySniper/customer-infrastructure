I will be honest and say that I haven't kept records of time spent per task. I will try to give a rough estimate based on my memory (and the git commits timestamps).

Important facts:

-No weekends worked, save for a single Sunday: 16 of August of 2020. 10 hours of work here.
-Mostly worked on weekedays evenings, from 20 to 23, sometimes 24.
-Skipped a few weekdays to avoid burn out
-Sometimes I had was idle at my current work and did some stuff there but this was unusual.
-The margin for error is quite big, so dont take the numbers for granted
